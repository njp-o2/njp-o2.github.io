Hey! I'm Nikolay.

I enjoy breaking things (on purpose), figuring out how they work, and putting them back together (if possible) — usually with a bit more understanding than before. I'm into networking, cybersecurity, and the weird corners of tech that most people overlook.

This website is my digital notebook — a place where I share what I’m learning, what I’m struggling with, or what I just found interesting enough to research.

I don’t claim to be an expert (yet) in the topics I write about — just someone who’s curious and trying to get a little better every day.

Thanks for stopping by!

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:njp-o2@gmail.com) if you’d like to connect!
